            <h2>Taylor Swift - How You Get The Girl</h2>
            
            <!--Song Lyrics-->
            <p> 
            Oh, oh, oh <br> 
            Oh, oh, oh <br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh
            </p>
            <p>
                Stand there like a ghost <br>
                Shaking come the rain, rain <br>
                She'll open up the door
                And say, are you insane, -ane?
            </p>

            <p>
                Say it's been a long six months (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br>
                And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
            </p>

            <p> 
                And that's how it works
                That's how you get the girl
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And then you say
                I want you for worse or for better <br>
                I would wait for ever and ever
                Broke your heart, <br> 
                I'll put it back together
                I would wait for ever and ever
            </p>    

            <p> 
                And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br>
        And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl
            </p>

            <p>
                Remind her how it used to be, be
        Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks <br>
        Tell her how you must've lost your mind (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br>
        When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
            </p>

            <p> 
                And that's how it works
        That's how you lost the girl
            </p>

            <p>
                And now you say
        I want you for worse or for better <br>
        I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever) <br>
        Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
        I would wait for ever and ever
            </p>

            <p>
                And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br>
        And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah
            </p>

            <p> 
                And you could know, oh
        That I don't want you to go
            </p>

            <p>
                Remind me how it used to be
        Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks <br>
        And say you want me, yeah, yeah
            </p>

            <p>
                And then you say I want you for worse or for better (worse or for better) <br>
        I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever) <br>
        Broke your heart, I'll put it back together <br>
        I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)
            </p>

            <p> 
                And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br>
        (That's how it works) and that's how it works <br>
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh (get the girl)
            </p>

            <p>
                and that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br>
        And that's how it works
        That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
            </p>

            <p>
                And that's how it works
        That's how you got the girl
            </p>
